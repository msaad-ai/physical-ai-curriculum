## Overview

This document defines the standard structure for all chapters in Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac). Following a consistent structure ensures a coherent learning experience and makes the content easier to navigate and understand.

## Required Chapter Structure

### 1. Title and Overview
```
# Chapter X: [Chapter Title]

## Overview
This chapter introduces students to [main topic]. Students will learn [key learning points] and [expected outcomes].
```

### 2. Learning Objectives
```
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
- [Objective 1: Specific, measurable outcome]
- [Objective 2: Specific, measurable outcome]
- [Objective 3: Specific, measurable outcome]
```

### 3. Table of Contents
```
## Table of Contents
1. [Main Section 1](#main-section-1)
2. [Main Section 2](#main-section-2)
3. [Main Section 3](#main-section-3)
4. [Glossary](#glossary)
5. [Summary](#summary)
```

### 4. Main Content Sections
Each main section should follow this pattern:

```

```
## [Implementation Title]
### Prerequisites
- [List of requirements]

### Steps
1. [Step 1 with detailed explanation]
2. [Step 2 with detailed explanation]
3. [Step 3 with detailed explanation]

### Code Example
\```python
# Example code with explanations
import example_module
# Code explanation
result = example_function()
\```

### Expected Output
[Description of what the student should see/observe]
```

### 6. Exercises Section (when applicable)
```
## Exercises
### Exercise 1: [Exercise Title]
#### Objective
[What the exercise aims to teach]

#### Prerequisites
[What students need to know/complete before starting]

```

## Additional Content Elements

### Diagrams and Visuals
When including diagrams, use this structure:
```
## [Diagram Title]
![Diagram Description](path/to/diagram.png)

_Figure X: [Detailed description of the diagram and its relevance to the content]_
```

### Code Blocks
For code examples, always include:
- Language specification after the opening triple backticks
- Brief description before the code
- Inline comments explaining complex parts
- Expected output or behavior after the code

### Mathematical Formulas
For mathematical concepts, use:
- LaTeX-style formulas when needed: `$formula$` for inline or `$$formula$$` for display
- Clear explanations of what each variable represents
- Examples showing how to apply the formulas

## Chapter-Specific Adaptations
