# VLA Module Glossary

This glossary contains key terms and definitions used throughout the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module.

## A

**Action Sequence**: A series of ROS 2 commands generated from natural language instructions, representing a planned course of action for the robot.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In this module, we use APIs for Whisper and LLM services.

**Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Technology that converts spoken language into text. Whisper is an example of an ASR system used in VLA systems.

## C

**Cognitive Planning**: The process of translating high-level natural language instructions into executable action sequences for a robot, involving reasoning and decision-making.

## H

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The field of study focused on designing, developing, and evaluating robotic systems for interaction with humans.

## L

**Large Language Model (LLM)**: Advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating human-like text. In this module, we use Claude for translating natural language to robot actions.

## N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, and tools for robotics applications.

## V

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: A system architecture that integrates visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action capabilities in robotics.

**Voice Command**: Natural language input captured through voice recognition systems that initiates robot actions.

## W

**Whisper**: OpenAI's automatic speech recognition (ASR) system used for converting voice commands to text in this module.

## G

**Gazebo**: A 3D simulation environment that provides realistic physics, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces for robotics simulation.

## S

**Simulation Mode**: A testing environment where robot actions are executed in a virtual environment rather than on physical hardware.

## P

**Pipeline**: A series of connected processing stages where the output of one stage becomes the input to the next, as in the VLA pipeline (Voice → LLM → Action → Robot).
