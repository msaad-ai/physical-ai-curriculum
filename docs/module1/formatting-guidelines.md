```

## Diagram Prompts

For diagrams to be generated by Claude, use this format:

## Key Formatting Rules

- Use H1 for chapter title (only once per document)

- Use H3 for subsections when needed
- Keep paragraphs concise (1-3 sentences when possible)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential instructions
- Include glossary terms in bold when first introduced
