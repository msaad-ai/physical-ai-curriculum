# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook! This module introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the "nervous system" of humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

- **ROS 2 Foundations**: Core concepts that make ROS 2 the backbone of robotic systems
- **Environment Setup**: How to configure your development environment for ROS 2
- **Node Communication**: How different components of a robot communicate with each other
- **URDF Basics**: How to describe robot structure and kinematics

## Why ROS 2 Matters for Humanoids

Humanoid robots are incredibly complex systems requiring seamless coordination between many subsystems. Just as our nervous system allows different parts of our body to communicate and work together, ROS 2 provides the infrastructure for all components of a humanoid robot to function as a unified system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Ubuntu 22.04 or compatible Linux system

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1: ROS 2 Foundations, where you'll learn about the core concepts that make ROS 2 essential for humanoid robotics applications.
