# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
Content must balance technical accuracy with accessibility for beginners; All explanations include practical examples and hands-on exercises; Every concept connects theory to real-world humanoid robotics applications.

### II. Simulation-Verified Content
All code examples must run successfully in ROS 2 + Digital Twin environment; Diagrams and explanations accurately reflect ROS 2, URDF, Gazebo, and Isaac workflows; Practical implementations validated through simulation before inclusion.

### III. Modular Learning Structure
Content organized in 4 modules with 4 chapters each for progressive learning; Each module builds upon previous concepts while maintaining conceptual independence; Self-contained units allow flexible learning paths and curriculum adaptation.

### IV. AI-Assisted Development
Leverage Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code for content creation and validation; Maintain human oversight for technical accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness; Integrate AI tools into iterative content refinement process.

### V. Technical Standards Compliance
All code follows ROS 2 best practices and standards; Markdown format compatible with Docusaurus for seamless deployment; Consistent writing style maintained throughout entire textbook.

### VI. Open Source Accessibility
All content freely available via GitHub Pages deployment; Contributions welcome through standardized pull request process; Documentation clear enough for community maintenance and expansion.

## Technical Standards
All code examples must be executable in ROS 2 environment with Digital Twin simulation; Diagrams created with tools that produce accurate representations of robotic systems; Markdown formatting follows Docusaurus guidelines for optimal presentation; Content tested across different viewing platforms and devices.

## Development Workflow
Content created through Spec-Driven Development methodology using SpecKit Plus; Each chapter undergoes technical review by robotics domain experts; All code examples tested in simulation environment before merge; Documentation follows consistent style guide across all modules.

## Governance
This constitution governs all content creation and technical decisions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook; Amendments require documentation of rationale and approval by project maintainers; All contributors must acknowledge and follow these principles; Regular compliance reviews ensure adherence to established standards.
