## Response Text

Successfully implemented Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) with all 50 tasks completed across 6 phases. Created comprehensive educational content including 5 chapters (intro, gazebo-setup, unity-setup, sensors-integration, mini-project), architecture diagrams, glossary, code templates, and validation documentation. All content follows the required section structure and meets educational objectives for teaching students to simulate humanoid robots in physics-based environments. All code snippets validated, diagrams embedded, and accessibility features implemented. The module is ready for student use with clear exercises and a comprehensive mini-project.
